# Autonomous AI Agent Creator System - Action Plan

This action plan is divided into multiple files due to its comprehensive nature:

1. [Part 1: Architecture & Design Phase, Core Framework Development](action_plan_part1.md) - Sections 1-4
2. [Part 2: User Interface & Experience, Documentation, Continuous Improvement, Architectural Analysis](action_plan_part2.md) - Sections 5-8
3. [Part 3: Agent Creation & Self-Improvement, Implementation Principles, Differentiators, Roadmap](action_plan_part3.md) - Sections 9-12

## Overview

This action plan outlines the implementation strategy for an autonomous AI agent creator system that can discover, process, and convert various company knowledge sources into specialized AI agents with minimal human intervention. The system focuses on:

1. **Scalability**: Independent modules and efficient resource utilization
2. **Modularity**: Clear boundaries and easy integration of future enhancements
3. **Autonomy**: Self-improving AI agents with balanced workload distribution
4. **Future-Proofing**: Minimal hard coding and easy incorporation of new frameworks

The plan is designed to be flexible in timeline while ensuring a solid foundation is built first.
