# Tool Management Service Test Documentation

This directory contains the test suite for the Tool Management Service. The tests are organized into three categories:

1. Unit Tests
2. Integration Tests
3. Performance Tests

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages:
  - pytest
  - pytest-cov
  - psutil (for performance tests)

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/          # Run unit tests
pytest tests/integration/   # Run integration tests
pytest tests/performance/   # Run performance tests
```

### Running Individual Tests

```bash
# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_tool_registry.py

# Run a specific test class
pytest tests/unit/test_tool_registry.py::TestToolRegistry

# Run a specific test method
pytest tests/unit/test_tool_registry.py::TestToolRegistry::test_register_tool
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation. Each component has its own test file:

- `test_tool_registry.py`: Tests for tool registration and management
- `test_tool_execution.py`: Tests for tool execution engine
- `test_tool_development_kit.py`: Tests for tool development utilities
- `test_mcp_compliance.py`: Tests for MCP compliance layer

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly. The main integration test file is:

- `test_tool_management_integration.py`: Tests complete workflows including:
  - Tool registration and execution
  - Dependency management
  - Version control
  - Error handling
  - Audit logging

### Performance Tests

Performance tests measure the service's behavior under various conditions:

- `test_tool_management_performance.py`: Tests for:
  - Registration performance
  - Execution performance
  - Concurrent execution
  - Memory usage
  - Audit logging performance

## Performance Requirements

The service must meet the following performance requirements:

### Tool Registration
- Average registration time < 100ms
- Maximum registration time < 500ms

### Tool Execution
- Simple tools:
  - Average execution time < 50ms
  - Maximum execution time < 200ms
- Complex tools:
  - Average execution time < 200ms
  - Maximum execution time < 500ms

### Concurrent Execution
- Average completion time < 300ms
- Maximum completion time < 1s

### Memory Usage
- Memory increase < 100MB for 1000 tools

### Audit Logging
- Average logging time < 100ms
- Maximum logging time < 500ms

## Test Data

Test data is generated dynamically in the test files. Each test category uses appropriate test data:

- Unit tests: Minimal test data
- Integration tests: Realistic workflows
- Performance tests: Large datasets and concurrent operations

## Mocking

The tests use Python's `unittest.mock` to mock external dependencies:

- AWS services (KMS, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Database operations
- External API calls

## Coverage Requirements

The test suite aims for:
- Line coverage > 90%
- Branch coverage > 85%
- Function coverage > 95%

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI pipeline:
- On every pull request
- On every push to main
- Daily scheduled runs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Test Failures**
   - Check AWS credentials for integration tests
   - Verify test data is properly set up
   - Check for concurrent test interference

2. **Performance Test Failures**
   - Verify system resources are available
   - Check for background processes
   - Verify network connectivity

3. **Coverage Issues**
   - Run tests with `--cov-report term-missing`
   - Check for untested edge cases
   - Verify all code paths are covered

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. Choose the appropriate test category
2. Follow the existing test patterns
3. Add appropriate docstrings
4. Update this documentation if necessary
5. Ensure test data is properly cleaned up

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test should be independent
   - Clean up test data after each test
   - Use appropriate setup and teardown

2. **Test Naming**
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow the pattern `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`
   - Include expected outcome in the name

3. **Test Documentation**
   - Document test purpose
   - Explain test data
   - Document expected outcomes

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test both success and failure cases
   - Verify error messages
   - Test edge cases

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Use appropriate timeouts
   - Clean up resources
   - Consider system load
