# Knowledge Processing Service

## Overview

The Knowledge Processing Service is responsible for ingesting, transforming, and preparing knowledge from various sources for use by the system and generated agents. It provides an extensible and efficient pipeline for discovering, connecting to, processing, and structuring knowledge from diverse corporate data sources with minimal human intervention.

## Objectives

- Create an extensible pipeline for processing knowledge from diverse sources
- Transform raw content into structured, searchable knowledge
- Generate embeddings for efficient semantic search
- Provide a standardized interface for other services to access processed knowledge
- Support incremental updates to knowledge sources

## Key Components

### 1. Source Connector System

- **Common Connector Interface**: Defines a standardized interface for all knowledge source connectors
- **Document Connectors**: Process PDF, DOCX, TXT, and other document formats
- **Database Connectors**: Extract knowledge from SQL and NoSQL databases
- **API Connectors**: Connect to REST, GraphQL, and other API sources
- **Web Connectors**: Crawl and extract information from websites
- **Connector Plugin System**: Allow for easy addition of future source types

### 2. Content Processing Pipeline

- **Pipeline Architecture**: Pluggable processors for different processing steps
- **Content Extraction**: Extract text and metadata from raw sources
- **Content Structuring**: Chunk, segment, and organize content
- **Relationship Extraction**: Identify relationships between content pieces
- **Embedding Generation**: Generate vector embeddings with model selection capabilities
- **Content Validation**: Ensure processed knowledge is accurate and complete
- **Incremental Processing**: Efficiently handle large sources and updates

### 3. Knowledge Storage Integration

- **Vector Storage**: Store and retrieve embeddings for semantic search
- **Knowledge Graph**: Represent relationships between knowledge entities
- **Metadata Storage**: Store and index metadata for filtering and organization
- **Storage Abstraction**: Support multiple storage backends

### 4. Knowledge Versioning

- **Version Control**: Track changes to knowledge over time
- **Change Tracking**: Identify what has changed between versions
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Revert to previous versions if needed

## Implementation Plan

- Implement content extraction and structuring
- Create embedding generation with model selection

### Phase 3: Storage Integration (Weeks 8-10)
- Implement vector storage integration
- Develop knowledge graph representation
- Create metadata storage and indexing

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 11-14)
- Implement incremental processing
- Develop knowledge versioning
- Create content validation and quality checks

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Weeks 15-16)
- Integrate with other services
- Develop comprehensive test suite
- Create documentation and examples

## Integration Points

### Provides To Other Modules
- **Processed knowledge** for Agent Generation Service
- **Knowledge retrieval API** for Agent Execution & Monitoring Service
- **Knowledge management interface** for User Interface Layer
- **Knowledge metrics** for System Continuous Improvement Service

### Requires From Other Modules
- **Configuration management** from Foundation Layer
- **Deployment abstraction** from Foundation Layer
- **Feedback on knowledge quality** from Agent Self-Improvement & Evolution Service

## Application of Design Principles

### Scalability
- Pipeline architecture allows for parallel processing of knowledge sources
- Storage abstractions support horizontal scaling
- Incremental processing enables efficient handling of large sources

### Modularity
- Clear separation between connectors, processors, and storage
- Plugin system for extending functionality
- Well-defined interfaces between components

### Autonomy
- Self-monitoring of knowledge quality
- Automatic detection of knowledge gaps
- Independent operation with minimal human intervention

### Future-Proofing
- Extensible connector system for new source types
- Model-agnostic embedding generation
- Storage abstractions for different backends
