# Config Manager Implementation Task

## Task Overview
You are assigned to implement the Config Manager component, which is a foundational component of the system. This component is responsible for loading, storing, and providing access to configuration settings throughout the system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anuraagsster/AI_agent_builder.git
   cd AI_agent_builder
   ```

2. Checkout the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/config-manager-implementation
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot-agents-creator/implementation/01_foundation_layer
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Implementation Requirements

### Files to modify:
- `src/config_management/config_manager.py`
- Create `tests/unit/test_config_manager.py` (based on the sample test file)

### Required methods/functions:
- `ConfigSource.load()`: Abstract method to load configuration from a source
- `ConfigSource.save(config)`: Abstract method to save configuration to a source
- `FileConfigSource.__init__(file_path)`: Initialize with file path
- `FileConfigSource.load()`: Load configuration from file (JSON or YAML)
- `FileConfigSource.save(config)`: Save configuration to file
- `ConfigManager.__init__(config_sources, schema_file, owner_id, environment)`: Initialize with sources and options
- `ConfigManager.load_config()`: Load configuration from all sources
- `ConfigManager.get_config(key, default)`: Get configuration value by key
- `ConfigManager.set_config(key, value)`: Set configuration value

### Design principles to follow:
- Scalability: Support multiple configuration sources with clear priority
- Modularity: Clear separation between configuration storage and access
- Autonomy: Self-validation of configuration values
- Future-Proofing: Support for multiple configuration formats
- Client Ownership: Prepare for client-specific configuration

## Resources
- Implementation Guide: See `implementation_guides/config_manager_guide.md`
- Sample Test: See `tests/unit/test_config_manager_sample.py`

## Submission Process
1. Implement the required functionality in this feature branch
2. Write unit tests to verify your implementation
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement Config Manager component"
   git push origin feature/config-manager-implementation
   ```
5. Create a pull request from `feature/config-manager-implementation` to `development`
6. Assign the pull request to the supervisor for review

## Acceptance Criteria
- ConfigSource base class is implemented with abstract methods
- FileConfigSource is implemented with support for JSON and YAML
- ConfigManager can load configuration from multiple sources
- ConfigManager can get and set configuration values using dot notation
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of the code
- Tests pass successfully
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Documentation is updated
