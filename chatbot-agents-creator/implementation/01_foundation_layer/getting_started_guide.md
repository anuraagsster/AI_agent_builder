# Getting Started Guide for Junior Developers

Welcome to the Chatbot Agents Creator project! This guide will help you get started with the implementation of the Foundation Layer.

## Project Overview

The Foundation Layer provides the core infrastructure and framework components upon which the entire Autonomous AI Agent Creator System is built. It establishes the fundamental principles of Scalability, Modularity, Autonomy, Future-Proofing, and Client Ownership.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/chatbot-agents-creator.git
cd chatbot-agents-creator
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r implementation/01_foundation_layer/requirements.txt
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Understand Your Task

1. Check your assigned GitHub issue for details
2. Read the relevant implementation guide in `implementation/01_foundation_layer/implementation_guides/`
3. Review the implementation status in `implementation/01_foundation_layer/implementation_status.md`

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/component-name-task-description

# Example:
git checkout -b feature/config-manager-basic
```

### 3. Implement Your Task

1. Follow the implementation guide for your component
2. Implement the required methods and classes
3. Follow the design principles:
   - Scalability
   - Modularity
   - Autonomy
   - Future-Proofing
   - Client Ownership

### 4. Write Tests

1. Create unit tests for all implemented functionality
2. Ensure at least 80% test coverage
3. Run tests to verify your implementation

```bash
# Run tests
pytest implementation/01_foundation_layer/tests/
```

### 5. Submit Your Work

1. Commit your changes with clear messages

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "[Component] Implement feature X"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/component-name-task-description
```

2. Create a pull request on GitHub
3. Fill out the pull request template
4. Request a review from the team lead

### 6. Address Review Feedback

1. Make any requested changes
2. Push additional commits to your branch
3. Respond to review comments

## Design Principles

When implementing components, always keep these design principles in mind:

### 1. Scalability
- Design for increased load
- Use asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Implement caching strategies

### 2. Modularity
- Create clear component boundaries
- Use well-defined interfaces
- Minimize coupling between components

### 3. Autonomy
- Implement self-monitoring capabilities
- Add error handling and recovery
- Design for minimal human intervention

### 4. Future-Proofing
- Use configuration-driven behavior
- Implement versioning for components
- Create abstraction layers for external dependencies

### 5. Client Ownership
- Add ownership metadata to components
- Implement export capabilities
- Create clear IP boundaries

## Asking for Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions:

1. Check the implementation guides first
2. Look at the implementation status file
3. Create a GitHub issue with the label "question"
4. Reach out to the team lead directly

## Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for better IDE support
- Write docstrings for all classes and methods
- Keep methods small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and method names

## Next Steps

1. Complete your assigned task for the day
2. Submit a pull request
3. Review the next day's tasks
4. Prepare for the next implementation

Happy coding!
