# Component Registry Implementation Instructions

## Task Overview
You are assigned to implement the Component Registry, which is a core architectural component of the system. This component is responsible for registering, retrieving, and managing components in the system, enabling modularity and extensibility.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure your local repository is up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   ```

2. Checkout the feature branch for this task:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/component-registry-implementation
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot-agents-creator/implementation/01_foundation_layer
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Implementation Requirements

### Files to modify:
- `src/architecture/component_registry.py`
- Update `tests/unit/test_component_registry.py` as needed

### Required methods/functions:
- `ComponentRegistry.__init__()`: Initialize the registry
- `ComponentRegistry.register(component_id, component, metadata=None)`: Register a component
- `ComponentRegistry.get(component_id)`: Get a component by ID
- `ComponentRegistry.list_components()`: List all registered components
- `ComponentRegistry.get_metadata(component_id)`: Get metadata for a component
- `ComponentRegistry.remove(component_id)`: Remove a component
- `ExtensionSystem.register_extension_point(name, interface)`: Register an extension point
- `ExtensionSystem.register_extension(point_name, extension)`: Register an extension for a point
- `ExtensionSystem.get_extensions(point_name)`: Get all extensions for a point

### Design principles to follow:
- Scalability: Support for a large number of components
- Modularity: Clear separation between component registration and usage
- Autonomy: Components should be self-contained
- Future-Proofing: Support for versioning and dependencies
- Client Ownership: Support for client-specific components

## Resources
- Implementation Guide: See `implementation_guides/component_registry_guide.md` or `implementation_guides/component_registry_guide_v2.md`
- Sample Test: See `tests/unit/test_component_registry.py`

## Submission Process
1. Implement the required functionality in this feature branch
2. Write comprehensive unit tests
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement Component Registry"
   git push origin feature/component-registry-implementation
   ```
5. Create a pull request from `feature/component-registry-implementation` to `development`
6. Assign the pull request to the supervisor for review

## Acceptance Criteria
- ComponentRegistry class is implemented with all required methods
- ExtensionSystem class is implemented with all required methods
- Components can be registered, retrieved, and removed
- Extensions can be registered and retrieved
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of the code
- Tests pass successfully
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Documentation is updated

## Dependencies
- Config Manager (for configuration)
