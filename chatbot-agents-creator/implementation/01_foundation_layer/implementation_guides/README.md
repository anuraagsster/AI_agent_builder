# Foundation Layer Implementation Guides

This directory contains detailed implementation guides for the Foundation Layer components. These guides are intended to help junior developers understand how to implement each component according to the project's design principles and requirements.

## Available Guides

### Core Infrastructure

- [Config Manager Guide](./config_manager_guide.md) - Implementation guide for the configuration management system
- [Component Registry Guide v2](./component_registry_guide_v2.md) - Updated implementation guide for the component registry with client ownership and serverless support

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [Client Ownership Integration Guide](./client_ownership_integration_guide.md) - Guide for implementing client ownership across components

## Upcoming Guides

The following guides are planned for future development:

### Agent Framework

- Base Agent Guide - Implementation guide for the base agent architecture
- Agent Communication Guide - Implementation guide for the agent communication system
- Framework Adapters Guide - Implementation guide for framework abstraction layers

### Workload Management

- Task Distributor Guide - Implementation guide for the task distribution system
- Resource Monitor Guide - Implementation guide for resource monitoring and management
- Quality Controller Guide - Implementation guide for the quality control system

### Deployment

- Resource Abstraction Guide - Implementation guide for the deployment abstraction layer
- Serverless Implementation Guide - Guide for implementing components in a serverless architecture

## Guide Structure

Each implementation guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the component and its purpose
2. **Design Principles Implementation** - How the component implements the core design principles
3. **Implementation Requirements** - Dependencies and class structure
4. **Implementation Steps** - Detailed steps for implementing each method
5. **Usage Example** - Example code showing how to use the component
6. **Testing** - Guidelines for testing the component
7. **Integration with Other Components** - How the component interacts with others
8. **Next Steps** - Future enhancements and integration points

## Development Process

When implementing a component:

1. Read the corresponding implementation guide thoroughly
2. Refer to the [implementation_status.md](../implementation_status.md) file to check the current status
3. Update the implementation status as you progress
4. Follow the coding standards and design principles outlined in the project documentation
5. Write unit tests for each component
6. Document any deviations from the guide or additional features

## Contribution Guidelines

If you want to contribute a new implementation guide:

1. Use the existing guides as templates
2. Follow the same structure and level of detail
3. Include comprehensive code examples
4. Document integration points with other components
5. Add the guide to this README file
