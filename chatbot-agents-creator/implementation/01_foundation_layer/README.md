# Foundation Layer (Core Infrastructure & Framework)

## Overview

The Foundation Layer provides the core infrastructure and framework components upon which the entire Autonomous AI Agent Creator System is built. This layer establishes the fundamental principles of Scalability, Modularity, Autonomy, and Future-Proofing that will guide the development of all other components.

## Objectives

- Create a robust, flexible, and scalable core infrastructure and framework
- Establish clear architectural patterns and component boundaries
- Provide dependency and configuration management systems
- Implement a deployment abstraction layer for consistent operation across environments
- Develop the base agent framework and workload management system

## Key Components
