- [ ] Secure handling of client-specific data

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests cover all public methods
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Test coverage is at least 80%
- [ ] Tests are well-organized and follow naming conventions
- [ ] Mocks and fixtures are used appropriately
- [ ] Tests are independent and don't rely on external state

## Security

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information
- [ ] Proper input validation
- [ ] Secure handling of sensitive data
- [ ] Appropriate access controls

## Performance

- [ ] No obvious performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Efficient algorithms and data structures
- [ ] Appropriate use of lazy loading
- [ ] No unnecessary computations or memory usage

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Implementation status file is updated
- [ ] All required tasks are marked as complete
- [ ] Any deviations from the implementation guide are documented

## Pull Request Quality

- [ ] PR description is clear and complete
- [ ] PR references the relevant issue(s)
- [ ] PR is of reasonable size (not too many changes at once)
- [ ] Commits are logical and have descriptive messages

## Component-Specific Checks

### Config Manager
- [ ] Supports multiple configuration sources
- [ ] Hierarchical configuration works correctly

- [ ] Client-specific configuration is isolated

### Component Registry
- [ ] Component lifecycle management works correctly

- [ ] Circular dependency detection works
- [ ] Component ownership tracking is implemented

### Base Agent
- [ ] Agent initialization and termination work correctly
- [ ] Task execution is implemented properly
- [ ] Agent state management is correct
- [ ] Ownership metadata is handled properly

### Agent Communication
- [ ] Message routing works correctly
- [ ] Synchronous and asynchronous communication are supported
- [ ] Message serialization/deserialization works
- [ ] Ownership-aware message routing is implemented

### Framework Adapters
- [ ] Correct translation between our system and external frameworks
- [ ] Framework-specific features are properly supported
- [ ] Ownership metadata is preserved
- [ ] Error handling for framework interactions

### Resource Abstraction
- [ ] Environment detection works correctly
- [ ] Resource scaling strategies are implemented
- [ ] Export packaging works for client deployment
- [ ] Secure communication for remote resources

### Workload Management
- [ ] Task distribution algorithm works correctly
- [ ] Resource monitoring captures relevant metrics
- [ ] Quality control verifies task results
- [ ] Client-specific workload isolation is implemented

## Feedback Guidelines

When providing feedback:

1. **Be specific**: Point to exact lines or sections of code
2. **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements, not just point out problems
3. **Explain why**: Help the developer understand the reasoning behind your feedback
4. **Prioritize issues**: Distinguish between critical issues and minor suggestions
5. **Acknowledge good work**: Point out well-implemented parts of the code
6. **Reference resources**: Link to relevant documentation or examples

## Review Process

1. **First pass**: Quick overview to understand the changes
2. **Detailed review**: Go through the code line by line
3. **Run the code**: Test the functionality locally if possible
4. **Check tests**: Review and run the tests
5. **Provide feedback**: Add comments to the PR
6. **Follow up**: Verify that feedback has been addressed

## Example Feedback

### Good Feedback:
> In `config_manager.py`, line 45: Consider using a defaultdict here to simplify this logic. This would eliminate the need for the explicit check and make the code more concise.

### Less Helpful Feedback:
> This code could be better.

## Conclusion

Remember that code reviews are a learning opportunity for junior developers. Be thorough but supportive, and use this as a chance to mentor and guide them toward better coding practices.
