## Task Assignment Process

1. Each morning, the team lead assigns the day's tasks to developers
2. Developers create feature branches for their tasks
3. At the end of the day, developers submit pull requests
4. The team lead reviews pull requests and provides feedback
5. Approved pull requests are merged to the develop branch
6. The next day's tasks are assigned based on progress

## Progress Tracking

Track progress using the implementation status file:

```
✅ Completed
🔄 In Progress
⬜ Not Started
```

Update the status as tasks are completed.

## Conclusion

This daily task assignment plan breaks down the Foundation Layer implementation into manageable chunks that can be assigned to junior developers. Each day's tasks are designed to be completable within a single workday and represent a logical grouping of related functionality.

By following this plan, we can ensure steady progress on the Foundation Layer implementation while maintaining code quality and consistency.
