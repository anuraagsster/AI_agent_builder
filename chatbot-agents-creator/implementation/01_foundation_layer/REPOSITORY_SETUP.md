# Foundation Layer Repository Setup

This document provides instructions for setting up the GitHub repository for the Foundation Layer implementation.

## Setup Completed

The following setup tasks have been completed:

1. **Directory Structure**: Created the basic directory structure for the Foundation Layer implementation
2. **GitHub Templates**: Created issue and pull request templates
3. **GitHub Workflow**: Set up CI/CD workflow for automated testing
4. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation including:
   - README.md with project overview and setup instructions
   - Implementation guides for each component
   - Getting started guide for junior developers
   - GitHub workflow guide
   - Code review checklist
   - Daily task assignments
5. **Sample Code**: Provided example implementations and unit tests
6. **Automation Scripts**: Created scripts for repository management:
   - GitHub issue creation
   - Branch protection setup
   - Project board setup
   - Developer onboarding

## Next Steps

To complete the repository setup and prepare for junior developer onboarding, follow these steps:

### 1. Push to GitHub

First, create a new GitHub repository and push the code:

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub (via web interface)
# Then push the local code
cd chatbot-agents-creator
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for Foundation Layer implementation"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-organization/chatbot-agents-creator.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Configure Repository Settings

Run the provided scripts to configure the repository:

```bash
cd implementation/01_foundation_layer/scripts

# Set up branch protection rules
./setup_branch_protection.py --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --repo your-org/chatbot-agents-creator

# Set up project board
./setup_project_board.py --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --repo your-org/chatbot-agents-creator
```

### 3. Create Initial Issues

Create the first day's implementation tasks:

```bash
# Create day 1 issues
./create_github_issues.py --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --repo your-org/chatbot-agents-creator --day 1
```

### 4. Prepare for Junior Developer Onboarding

1. Schedule an onboarding session with the junior developers
2. Share the Getting Started Guide with them before the session
3. During the session, walk through the repository structure and implementation plan
4. Have them run the onboarding script:

```bash
cd chatbot-agents-creator/implementation/01_foundation_layer
./scripts/developer_onboarding.py
```

5. Assign the first day's issues to the developers
6. Set up a code review process and schedule daily check-ins

## Client Ownership Integration

The Foundation Layer implementation includes client ownership support as a core design principle. This ensures that:

1. All agents and components track client ownership metadata
2. Client-specific configurations are properly isolated
3. Export and import capabilities are available for client data
4. Ownership verification mechanisms are in place
5. Secure data handling with client-specific encryption is implemented

Refer to the [Client Ownership Integration Guide](implementation_guides/client_ownership_integration_guide.md) for detailed implementation instructions.

## Serverless Architecture

The Foundation Layer is designed to work in a serverless environment, primarily using AWS services:

1. AWS Lambda for compute
2. DynamoDB for storage
3. API Gateway for API endpoints
4. S3 for file storage
5. Cognito for authentication

The deployment abstraction layer ensures that components can run both locally and in the cloud without code changes.
