# Foundation Layer Implementation Tasks

This file tracks the implementation tasks for the Foundation Layer components. Each task has a clear status and is implemented sequentially.

## Task Status Legend

- âœ… COMPLETED: Task has been fully implemented and tested
- ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Task is currently being worked on
- â¬œ TODO: Task is planned but not yet started

## Current Task

ðŸ”„ **Implement Component Registry**

The Component Registry is a core architectural component that enables modularity and extensibility in the system. This component is responsible for registering, retrieving, and managing components in the system.

### Required methods/functions:
- `ComponentRegistry.__init__()`: Initialize the registry
- `ComponentRegistry.register(component_id, component, metadata=None)`: Register a component
- `ComponentRegistry.get(component_id)`: Get a component by ID
- `ComponentRegistry.list_components()`: List all registered components
- `ComponentRegistry.get_metadata(component_id)`: Get metadata for a component
- `ComponentRegistry.remove(component_id)`: Remove a component
- `ExtensionSystem.register_extension_point(name, interface)`: Register an extension point
- `ExtensionSystem.register_extension(point_name, extension)`: Register an extension for a point
- `ExtensionSystem.get_extensions(point_name)`: Get all extensions for a point

### Design principles to follow:
- Scalability: Support for a large number of components
- Modularity: Clear separation between component registration and usage
- Autonomy: Components should be self-contained
- Future-Proofing: Support for versioning and dependencies
- Client Ownership: Support for client-specific components

### Resources:
- Implementation Guide: See `implementation_guides/component_registry_guide.md` or `implementation_guides/component_registry_guide_v2.md`
- Sample Test: See `tests/unit/test_component_registry.py`

## Completed Tasks

âœ… **Implement Config Manager**

The Config Manager is responsible for loading, storing, and providing access to configuration settings throughout the system. It supports hierarchical configuration, validation, environment-specific settings, and dynamic updates.

### Implemented features:
- ConfigSource base class with abstract methods
- FileConfigSource implementation with JSON and YAML support
- ConfigManager with support for multiple configuration sources
- Hierarchical configuration with dot notation access
- Environment-specific configuration handling
- Client-specific configuration isolation
- Configuration validation
- Environment variable overrides
- Configuration export/import capabilities
