# Next Task Assignment: Component Registry Implementation

## Message to Junior Developer

Great job on implementing the Config Manager component! Your pull request has been reviewed and will be merged into the development branch. 

For your next task, please implement the Component Registry component. This is a core architectural component that enables modularity and extensibility in the system.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure your local repository is up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   ```

2. Checkout the feature branch for this task:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/component-registry-implementation
   ```

3. Read the task instructions in the `COMPONENT_REGISTRY_TASK.md` file in this branch

## Implementation Requirements

You'll need to implement:

1. The ComponentRegistry class with methods for:
   - Registering components
   - Retrieving components
   - Listing all components
   - Getting component metadata
   - Removing components

2. The ExtensionSystem class with methods for:
   - Registering extension points
   - Registering extensions
   - Getting extensions for a point

## Dependencies

The Component Registry will use the Config Manager that you just implemented. This is a good opportunity to see how components in the system work together.

## Submission Process

1. Implement the required functionality in the feature branch
2. Write comprehensive unit tests
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Commit your changes and push to the remote branch
5. Create a pull request from `feature/component-registry-implementation` to `development`
6. Assign the pull request to me for review

## Need Help?

If you have any questions or need clarification, please add comments to your commits or create a draft pull request with your questions.

I look forward to reviewing your implementation of the Component Registry!
