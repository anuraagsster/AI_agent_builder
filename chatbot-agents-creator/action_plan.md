## 10. Implementation Principles for Created Agents

### 10.1 Scalability Inheritance

Created agents will inherit the following scalability principles:

1. **Resource Self-Management**: Agents monitor and manage their own resource usage
2. **Adaptive Processing**: Adjust processing depth based on available resources
3. **Incremental Knowledge Handling**: Process knowledge in manageable chunks
4. **Asynchronous Operations**: Use non-blocking operations for resource-intensive tasks
5. **Caching Strategies**: Implement intelligent caching for frequent operations
6. **Load Shedding**: Gracefully handle overload situations

### 10.2 Modularity Inheritance

Created agents will inherit the following modularity principles:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Built from interchangeable components
2. **Interface-Driven Design**: All components interact through well-defined interfaces
3. **Capability Registration**: Dynamically register and discover capabilities
4. **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Minimize hard coding through configuration
5. **Extension Points**: Pre-defined points for adding new functionality
